# Katha User Authentication Fix

This update fixes user authentication and account creation in the Katha credit management system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Account Creation Issues**
   - Fixed registration not saving user data to database
   - Added proper password hashing using werkzeug security
   - Ensured business accounts automatically get a PIN assigned

2. **Login Issues**
   - Fixed login verification to properly check password hashes
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Fixed session management for business and customer accounts

3. **Database Connectivity**
   - Improved error handling for database connection failures
   - Added database initialization script to ensure all required tables and functions exist
   - Fixed mock data mode that was preventing proper database usage

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Update the Database Schema**
   ```
   ./run_db_updates.sh
   ```
   This will run the initialization script and make sure all necessary database tables and functions exist.

2. **Restart the Application**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Create a New Account**
   - If you had trouble registering before, try creating a new account
   - The password will now be properly hashed and stored
   - Business accounts will automatically get an access PIN
   - Customer accounts will be properly associated with the user

## Technical Details

1. **Password Handling**
   - Now using Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash` functions
   - The old password comparison was not secure and was bypassing the database

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error reporting and feedback to users
   - Added fallback UI for when database is unavailable

3. **Account Creation**
   - Fixed the `register_user` SQL function to properly create user accounts
   - Added automatic creation of customer profiles when missing
   - Fixed automatic PIN generation for businesses
