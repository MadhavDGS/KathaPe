# KathaPe Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

The application was experiencing an error due to a syntax issue in the `flask_app.py` file. The problem was located at around line 929, where there was an improper nesting of try-except blocks in the login route.

**Error message:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (flask_app.py, line 929)
```

## Deployment Preparation

1. The syntax error has been fixed by properly restructuring the try-except blocks in the login route.
2. The code now properly handles all error cases with appropriate fallbacks.

## Render Deployment Recommendations

For optimal performance and reliability on Render, make the following configuration changes:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Add `RENDER_EMERGENCY_LOGIN=true` to ensure login works even if the database connection fails
   - Set `FLASK_ENV=production` for optimal performance

2. **Render Configuration:**
   - Increase worker timeout from 180 seconds to at least 240 seconds in your render.yaml:
     ```yaml
     services:
       - type: web
         # other settings...
         healthCheckPath: /api/heartbeat
         envVars:
           - key: PYTHON_VERSION
             value: 3.9.0
         buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
         startCommand: gunicorn wsgi:app --workers=2 --timeout=240
     ```
   - Reduce worker count from 8 to 2 to prevent resource exhaustion

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Use the `/api/status` endpoint to check application health
   - Use the `/api/heartbeat` endpoint for quick health checks

## Troubleshooting

If the application fails to start after deployment:

1. Check the Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that the `flask_app.py` and `wsgi.py` files have been properly uploaded
3. Set `RENDER_EMERGENCY_LOGIN=true` to bypass database connectivity issues
4. If database connectivity is an issue, check your Supabase credentials and ensure the service is running

## Additional Emergency Features

The application has been updated with several emergency fallbacks:

1. Emergency login that works even when the database is unavailable
2. Socket-based connectivity tests with short timeouts
3. Thread-based query timeouts to prevent worker hanging
4. Multiple fallback points in the login process
5. Static HTML fallbacks for when templates fail to render
